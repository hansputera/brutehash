# BruteHash
Brute force hash by guessing from 1 character and until it finds the result.

This time it can only find hashes with alphabets.

The algorithms here are MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA224, SHA384, SHA256, SHA512, and Bcrypt (never tested).
In general, finding 4 characters of alphabets will take 2 minutes or 3 minutes. And for characters length than 15 or 20 it will take an estimated 1 or 2 hours. It all depends on the algorithm, and the difficulty of the character.
